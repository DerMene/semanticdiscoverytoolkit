Notes on dependencies.


- io -- has no dependencies
  - put input/output related utilities with no external dependencies here.

- util -- only depends on "io"
  - put utilities with no external dependencies (other than on "io") here.
  - also depends on external
		- J2EE Mail (mail.jar) for EmailUtil
    - Apache Commons Command Line Interface (commons-cli-1.1.jar) for util.cmd

- xml -- depends on "io" and "util"
  - holds xml related utilities

- nlp -- depends on "io", "util", and "xml"
  - holds nlp related utilities

- cio -- depends on "io", "util" and "xml"
  - put input/output related utilities that also depend on "util" and "xml" here.

- bdb -- depends on "io", "util", and "cio"
  - also depends on external
	  - BerkeleyDB (je-3.3.75.jar)
    - Apache Commons Command Line Interface (commons-cli-1.1.jar)

- text -- depends on all of the above
	- also depends on external
		- Lucene (for text.lucene package)
        - NOTE: it is feasible to have lucene as its own module to avoid this
								dependency on text. For now, I've decided to keep "lucene" under "text".
			- lucene-core-2.4.1.jar (core lucene)
			- lucene-highlighter-2.4.1.jar (lucene highligher methods)

Call all of the above the "base" tools
==============================================================================

- cluster -- depends on all of the base tools except nlp
	- also depends on external
		- J2EE Mail (mail.jar) [because of using util.EmailUtil]
    - Apache Commons Command Line Interface (commons-cli-1.1.jar)
  - TestDataPusher
		- requires ssh to localhost to work without interaction

- extract -- depends on all of the base tools except bdb
  - also depends on external
		- Weka (weka-3-6-0.jar) [used by classifier package]
