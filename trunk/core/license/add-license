# add-license
#
# Add the license text to the source-code file argument.
# The license to add is that which is contained in the file identified by
# the "LICENSE" environment variable or defaults to the
# "source-code-license.txt" file in the current directory.
#
# Usage:
#
# add-license <java-file>
#
# Example:
#
#  To add a license to all currently unlicensed source code files:
#  % export LICENSE="$PWD/source-code-license.txt"
#  % export $TRUNK="<path to source code root>"
#  % find $TRUNK -name '*.java' -exec add-license \{\} \;
#
test -n "$LICENSE" || LICENSE="source-code-license.txt";

if ! test -e "$LICENSE"; then
  echo "Must identify the license file using env var 'LICENSE'"
  exit 1;

sourcefile="$1";
curlicense=`head "$sourcefile" | grep 'Copyright'`;
generated=`head -n1 "$sourcefile" | grep 'Generated by'`;

if test -z "$curlicense" && test -z "$generated"; then
  # add the license if it isn't present.
  echo "adding $LICENSE to $sourcefile";

  cat "$LICENSE" "$sourcefile" > "$sourcefile.licensed";
