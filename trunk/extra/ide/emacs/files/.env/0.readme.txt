This development environment should be loaded from ~/.profile with a line like:

  test -s .env/.profile.env && . .env/.profile.dev


To configure the environment, inspect .vars and edit anything that needs to be changed for your environment.

On shell startup, ~/.profile is loaded.

.profile will load ~/.env/.profile.dev
.env/.profile.dev will load .env/.vars and .env/.classpath_def
