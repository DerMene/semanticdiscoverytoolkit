General-purpose data structures and processing for matching.

==== MODEL ====

The model (ConceptModel) can be expressed as a tree with the following data at each level from
the root down to the leaves.

MatchConcept
 - has an integer id (to map to general concept data) as the root of the tree.
 - is decomposed as an ordered list of ConceptTerms.
 - match input across all concept terms.
 - maps normalized words to their orthographic variants.

ConceptTerm
 - has a decomposition type (Decomp.Type).
 - has a flag for whether this term is optional or necessary to express the concept.
 - has a set of TermSynonyms.
 - match input with best term synonym.

TermSynonym
 - has a synonym type (Synonym.Type).
 - has a set of OrthographicVariants.
 - match input with best orthographic synonym.
 - each variation of a term is a new synonym.
   - In additional to traditional (looked-up table) synonyms, there may be:
     - concept (full) text with conjunctions
     - concept (partial) text between conjunctions
     - concept text without a defined acronym
     - concept text using defined acronym in place of its expanded form

OrthographicVariant
 - has a variant type (Variant.Type).
 - has a sequence of WordDatas.
 - the full orthographic variant string is to be defined as a valid dictionary string.
 - match/score input across all words.

WordData
 - has a word type (Word.Type).
 - has the normalized word text as a leaf of the tree.
 - normal word text is indexed for retrieving a concept record.

==== TYPES ====

DecompType
 - a type identifying the meaning or context of a concept term decomposed from the full match concept.

SynonymType
 - a type identifying the process used to generate a term synonym for a concept term.

VariantType
 - a type identifying the characteristics of an othrographic variant and/or how it was generated.

WordType
 - a type distinguishing special words (acronyms, functional words, numbers) from normal (content) words.
