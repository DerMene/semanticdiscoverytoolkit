package org.sd.cluster.io.package;


<p>This package is responsible for managing sockets and communications
between nodes.
</p>
<p>In general, communications across the cluster are always
asynchronous and forward. This is to prevent communication bottlenecks
and limit network traffic. In message passing, however, brief two-way
communications are used for servers to acknowledge receipt of messages
and to return information to clients on request. The responses should
always be kept light and small while the bulk of a message's work is in
forward motion through the cluster.
</p>
<p>Nodes communicate by transporting Message instances. A NodeServer
listens on a port. A NodeClient will synchronously send a message to
one ore more servers and receive the message's response from each
server. It is up to consumers of the client to handle message
responses. After replying to the message, the server handles the
message. Each message is handled on a thread from a pool by the server.
</p>
<p>Typical usage for establishing communication between two nodes is as
follows:
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td
 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Server(s)</td>
      <td
 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Client(s)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code><pre>
NodeServer server = null;
try {
  server = new NodeServer(serverAddress,
                          numSocketThreads,
                          numMessageHandlerThreads);
  server.start();
      
  //...let the server listen and handle messages...
      
  server.shutdown(false); // let the server shutdown gracefully
}
finally { // make sure server is shutdown properly
  if (server != null) server.shutdown(true);
}
      </pre></code></td>
      <td><code><pre>
NodeClient client = null;
try {
  client = new NodeClient(clientAddress, numSocketThreads);
  client.start();
      
  // send messages and manage responses
  Message[] responses = client.sendMessage(serverAddresses,
                                           message,
                                           checkInterval,
                                           timeout,
                                           timeLimit); 
      
 client.shutdown(false); // let the client shutdown gracefully
}
finally { // make client is shutdown properly
  if (client != null) client.shutdown(true);
}
      </pre></code></td>
    </code></tr>
