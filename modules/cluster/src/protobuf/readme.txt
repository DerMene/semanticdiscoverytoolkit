This area is used for protobuf definitions from which code is generated.

To manually force regeneration of the code, change to the 'bin' directory and execute the 'protogen' script.

If/when the protobuf definitions are modified, the corresponding code should be regenerated by ant.

If/when additional .protos are added, update the 'protogen' script and this module's build.xml accordingly.

(TODO: automate the update process.)
