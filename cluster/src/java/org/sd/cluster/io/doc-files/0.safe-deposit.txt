Safe Deposit abstraction:

- A SafeDepositBox has Drawers for holding the contents (output) of a process.
- A SafeDepositMessage initiates generation of the contents or retrieves the current status or finished contents.
- A SafeDepositReceipt is the return value from sending a SafeDepositMessage.
- A SafeDepositAgent is used to send SafeDepositMessage instances to multiple nodes and collect all responses.
	- it works under time limits to ensure at least a partial response when nodes die, fail, or fail to respond in time.
	- For each node (or node group), the message is sent via a console and the responses are collected.
		- The message is repeatedly sent until
			- the generated contents are available or
			- time expires or
			- the estimated time to completion would exceed the expiration time
