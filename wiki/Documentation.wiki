#summary Project documentation

= Introduction =

The following (evolving) sources provide documentation for this project:

  * Code javadocs
  * Test results
  * Notes files within the repository
  * Wiki pages

= Details =

== Javadocs ==

Javadocs are generated by the ant build from the source (see [http://code.google.com/p/semanticdiscoverytoolkit/wiki/Building Building]) using the target "javadoc" at the top level as well as for each module. The "javadoc" target is also invoked through the "all" target.

Once built, the javadocs are available at each module's _module_/build/doc/index.html

Ideas and information about publishing the javadocs online are welcome. A continuous integration build that automatically publishes updated artifacts would be ideal. In the meantime, you'll need to download and build the javadocs locally and/or use the other documentation included here.

== Test results ==

Along with javadocs, the build also generates html-formatted unit test results through the "test" or "all" targets.

You will find the unit test reports at each module's _module_/build/reports/html/index.html

== Notes files ==

Scattered through the code base are "doc-files" directories with notes files within. Sometimes these files give insight into the ideas behind the design of particular components and include "todo" lists.

== Wiki pages ==

As the project progresses, it is intended to document each of the components through these wiki pages and place links to them here. Ultimately and ideally, linking high level problems, needs, and goals with the components available to solve them is desired.
